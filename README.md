A lightweight RL framework with PyTorch-like interfaces.

</div>

## Features

- **FSDP2** and **FSDP** support for training.
- `vLLM` support for inference.
- `ray` support for resource management.
- Easy to learn and use. Most interfaces are kept the same as Torch, with parallel engine working seamlessly behind the scenes.
- [Recipes](https://github.com/rlite-project/RLite-Recipe) that reproduce SOTA results with a single self-contained python script.

## Installation

```python
pip install pyrlite
```

<details>

<summary>Advanced installation options</summary>

We recommend using `conda` to manage our computation environment.

1. Create a conda environment:

```
conda create -n rlite python==3.12
conda activate rlite
```

2. Install common dependencies

```bash
# install vllm
pip install vllm accelerate

# flash attention 2 (make sure you have 64 CPU cores)
MAX_JOBS=64 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

# Install fashinfer for faster inference
pip install flashinfer-python==0.2.2.post1 -i https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu124/torch2.6
```

4. Install `rlite`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlite-project/RLite.git
cd RLite; pip install -e .
```

## Recipes

We use [recipes](https://github.com/rlite-project/RLite-Recipe) as examples for reproducing SOTA RL methods. Featured recipes

- [Vanilla GRPO](https://github.com/rlite-project/RLite-Recipe/tree/main/recipe/on_policy_grpo_math_verifiable_reward)
- [LoRA GRPO](https://github.com/rlite-project/RLite-Recipe/tree/main/recipe/grpo_lora)

## Programming Model

![Programming Model](assets/docs/source/intrudoction/program_model.jpg)

In RLite, users mainly work with **Engine**s, which is a handler that takes the input from the main process, organizes the tasks and sends to the workers. The engine may have multiple **Executor**s, each holding a full set of model weights. Both Engines and Executors reside in the main process. The **Worker**s are the units that actually perform computational tasks, with each Worker corresponding to a GPU. Conversely, a single GPU can be associated with multiple Workers, which can use the GPU in a time-multiplexed manner.

## Key Interfaces

RLite provide minimal interfaces that are

- **easy to learn**: most interfaces resembles the behavior of PyTorch.
- **super flexible**: interfaces are independent and can be used seperately. This allows inference without training, e.g. evaluation tasks, or training without inference, e.g. SFT and DPO.
- **super powerful**: the interfaces combined together allows reproduction of SOTA RL results.
- **highly extensible**: the interfaces allows extensions for fancy features such as other train/inference backends, streaming generations for multi-turn use cases, asynchronized workers for overlapping time-consuming operations.

> Write code that you would like to read again.

We use `pre-commit` and `git cz` to sanitize the commits. You can run `pre-commit` before `git cz` to avoid repeatedly input the commit messages.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
# Install this emoji-style tool
sudo npm install -g git-cz --no-audit --verbose --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com

# Install rlite
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

##### Code Style

- Single line code length is 99 characters, comments and documents are 79 characters.
- Write unit tests for atomic capabilities to ensure that `pytest` does not throw an error.

Run `pre-commit` to automatically lint the code:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

##### Run Unit Tests:

```bash
# Only run tests
pytest

# Run tests and output test code coverage report
pytest --cov=rlite
```
